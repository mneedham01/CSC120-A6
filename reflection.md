- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance made it less repetitive to code but also a little more complicated to sort out the relationships between the classes. Going through the assignment went pretty smoothly, the only difficulty was with using the hashtable methods (especially using containsKey not contains was a big discovery). I would say to start early and do the assignment in lots of little chunks.
